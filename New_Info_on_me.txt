New Info on me

I work as a Project Manager for software and systems implementations.
My speciality is Process Improvement and Change Management

I want to expand into IT software, and be more hands on

I am taking free courses on Udacity, Stanford Online, Codecademy and Free Code Camp

Git is interesting. Not always easy, but just takes practise.
